# YOLOv8-Thermal-Object-Detection
This project focuses on applying YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to thermal infrared images captured by UAVs (drones). Using the HIT-UAV dataset, the goal is to detect and classify five types of objects — Person, Car, Bicycle, OtherVehicle, and DontCare — from high-altitude thermal imagery.
